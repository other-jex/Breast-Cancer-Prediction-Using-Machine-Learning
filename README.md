# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to predict breast cancer diagnosis, classifying tumors as **benign** or **malignant**.  
By analyzing features from cell nuclei, it helps in **early detection** and supports healthcare professionals in decision-making.

## 🧪 Dataset
The model uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, which includes features such as:

- 🟢 Radius  
- 🟢 Texture  
- 🟢 Perimeter  
- 🟢 Area  
- 🟢 Smoothness  
- 🟢 Compactness  
- 🟢 Concavity  
- 🟢 Concave Points  
- 🟢 Symmetry  
- 🟢 Fractal Dimension
